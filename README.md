### 📌 Recommendations Based on the Call Center Analysis
- **Improve Negative Sentiment Rate (47% of calls)**
  - Train frontline agents on empathy, de-escalation, and resolution skills.
  - Introduce a real-time feedback system (thumbs up/down or post-call surveys) to identify and resolve high-frustration areas.
  - Conduct a root-cause analysis for repeat complaints or long-resolution calls.

- **Prioritize Billing Questions**
  - Automate billing FAQs with chatbots or IVRs to reduce the volume of calls to human agents.
  - Create a specialized escalation team for complex billing disputes.

- **Optimize Use of Channels**
  - Since chatbots and email handle over 60% of calls, invest in improving these self-service systems.
  - Add smart routing to escalate unresolved chatbot and email conversations directly to live agents.
